   <h2> C Language Introduction</h2>

 <pre> C is a procedural programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972 at Bell Laboratories of AT&T Labs. </pre>

 <h4>Why Should We Learn C?</h4>
 <pre>
 Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the 
 C language like the syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages that
 are mainly based on the C language. </pre><br>

 <h4>Algorithms</h4>
 <pre>
 An algorithm is a step-by-step, finite set of well-defined instructions or rules
 designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It takes an input,
 processes it, and produces an output within a finite amount of time. Algorithms are
 the foundation of computer science and programming, enabling software and
 systems to function efficiently and accurately.<br>
 <b>Key Characteristics of an Algorithm</b>
 1.<b>Input:</b> The algorithm receives input, which is the data that will be processed.<br>
 2.<b>Output: </b>The algorithm produces an output after processing the input.<br>
 3.<b>Definiteness: </b>Each step of the algorithm must be precisely and unambiguously defined.<br>
 4.<b>Finiteness: </b>The algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.<br>
 5.<b>Effectiveness: </b>The steps must be basic enough to be carried out, in principle, by a human using paper and pencil.<br>
 6.<b>Generality:</b> The algorithm should be applicable to a broad set of inputs, not just a single instance.
 </pre><br>
 <h4>An algorithm should possess the following characteristics</h4>
 1.Each and every instruction should be precise and clear<br>
 2.Each instruction should be performed a finite number of times.<br>
 3.The algorithm should ultimately terminate<br>
 4.When the algorithm terminates the desired result should be obtained<br>

 <h4>Algorithm</h4>

 2.Input/Read <br>
 3.Process<br>
 4Decision<br>
 5.Print<br>

 <h4>Example of a Simple Algorithm </h4> 
 Calculate Summation of 3 no<br>                       
 i.Start<br>
 ii.Input A,B,C<br>
 iii.Sum = A+B+C<br>
 iv.Print <br>
 v.End<br>

 <h4>Flowchart</h4>
 ‚Ä¢A flowchart is a visual representation of the sequence of steps and decisions needed to perform a process.<br>
 ‚Ä¢Each step in the sequence is noted within a diagram shape. <br>
 ‚Ä¢Steps are linked by connecting lines and directional arrows.<br>
 ‚Ä¢ This allows anyone to view the flowchart and logically follow the process from beginning to end<br>
