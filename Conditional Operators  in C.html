            <p>The conditional operator is also known as a ternary operator.</p>
            <p>The conditional statements are the decision-making statements which depend upon the output of the expression.</p>
            <p>It is represented by two symbols, i.e., <strong>'?'</strong> and <strong>':'</strong>.</p>
            <p>As the conditional operator works on three operands, it is also known as the ternary operator.</p>

            <h3>Meaning of the Syntax</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Expression1:</strong> A Boolean condition that can be either true or false.</li>
                <li>If <strong>Expression1</strong> is true, <strong>Expression2</strong> will execute.</li>
                <li><strong>Expression2:</strong> True when it returns a non-zero value.</li>
                <li>If <strong>Expression1</strong> is false, <strong>Expression3</strong> will execute.</li>
                <li><strong>Expression3:</strong> False when it returns a zero value.</li>
