                Unlike for and while loops, which test the loop condition at the top of the loop,
                the do...while loop in C programming checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except for the fact that it is guaranteed
                to execute at least one time.
